How much code are we saving by creating a false 1:1 equivalence?\n\nDo we have any other functions that conveniently return a tuple of 2 structs just because the parameters to build them overlap?\n\nAs per suggestions elsewhere, I suggest that we move to returning packed structs rather than unpacked structs. I think it\u0027s the only-and-only common denominator.",
