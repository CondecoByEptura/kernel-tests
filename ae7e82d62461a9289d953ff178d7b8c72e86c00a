      "message": "Actually I just think it\u0027s a tradeoff between vertical space and horizontal space. One parameter per line is very hard to read in small windows because it takes up a disproportionate amount of vertical space. Even maximised on a 30\" monitor, gerrit only displays about 96 lines. CreateTunnel takes 10 parameters; take two of them like we have here and add some review comments and that\u0027s half your screen occupied by what is in effect one logical operation (creating a bidirectional tunnel). Worse if you don\u0027t maximise browser windows.\n\nOTOH, the 80-character line limit makes it advantageous to do side-by-side editing. On the same 30\" monitor you can display at least 4 files side-by-side.\n\nIt boils down to personal preference. Let\u0027s not argue about that?",
