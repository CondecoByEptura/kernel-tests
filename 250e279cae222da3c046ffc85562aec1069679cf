      "message": "Actually I think the kernel tests at HEAD will pass on both python 2 and python 3 at the moment. Do they not work for you?\n\nThe reason I made these tests compatible with both python 2 and python 3 was that at the time the debian VM disk image we use for the UML-based tests still hadn\u0027t been updated to support python 3. Do you know if that has been fixed?",

      "message": "When was it made available on dl.google.com? At some point I heard it was blocked due to some China-specific review issues, when was that resolved?\n\nIn any case - no objection to removing python 2 support if it\u0027s really not needed. In this case, could you split this effort into a few phases? Something like:\n\n1. Update the default version of the rootfs file from 20150203 to 20221014 and update the rootfs build scripts accordingly.\n2. Update the documentation at https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/network_tests to change \"Python 2.x\" to \"Python 3.x\" or \"Python\".\n3. Wait a while to see if builds turn red or users of this code (e.g., OEMs) report issues.\n4. Proceed with something like the rest of this CL.\n5. After a while, delete the old rootfs.\n\nIn step #4, can we avoid having changing all the #!/usr/bin/python shebang lines to #!/usr/bin/python3 ? The explicit 3 definitely doesn\u0027t seem to be required on Android.",
