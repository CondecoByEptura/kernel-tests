      "message": "This constant is at the netlink protocol level rather than the route level. We have a file that defines and manages the netlink protocol, which is netlink.h. This file concerns itself with the route protocol. Since the route protocol also has a number of independent sub-protocols (links, addresses, routes, neighbors, and rules), I\u0027m of the opinion those should also be split up, but for the NETLINK_\u003cproto\u003e constants, it\u0027s cut-and-dried. You may always invoke the \"my codebase my rules\", but there are not two logically support-able positions here.
