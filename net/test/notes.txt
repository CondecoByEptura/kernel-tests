Debian 7 wheezy, Debian 8 jessie, Debian 9 stretch, Debian 10 buster:
  32-bit PC [Intel x86-based]  (i386)
  64-bit PC [AMD64 & Intel 64] (amd64)
  ARM EABI (armel)
  ARMv7 [ARM with hardware fpu] (EABI hard-float ABI, armhf)
  64-bit ARM (arm64)

armhf === armv7 + vpf3-d16 + Thumb-2   a.k.a. cortex

5.1.7. (stretch+) Minimum requirement for 32-bit Intel is now i686 (with a minor exception)

The 32-bit PC support (known as the Debian architecture i386) now no longer
covers a plain i586 processor. The new baseline is the i686, although some
i586 processors (e.g. the “AMD Geode”) will remain supported.

The supported i586 processors have all the features of an i686 processor
except the “long NOP” (NOPL) instruction. The following shell script may be
a useful indicator (assuming only one processor is installed in the machine):

grep -q '^flags.*\bfpu\b.*\btsc\b.*\bcx8\b.*\bcmov\b' /proc/cpuinfo \
&& echo "OK (assuming all CPUs are of the same type)"

486dx adds 'fpu', pentium adds 'tsc' and 'cx8', pentium pro adds 'cmov'
